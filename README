# Morse Code in C

### Options:

`--interactive` or `-i` will make you able to any phrase.

`--verbose` or `-v` will add the letter bring printed before the morse code (e.g. (C)-.-.)

You can pipe data in to be morse codeified

### Limits:

`65535` bytes of data is the maximum amount currently allowed in one go.
This will *probably* change later, but I don't know how it works really.

### Tests:

`cat gettysburg.txt | ./morse` should let you know if something went wrong.
It's quite a long passage in terms of what this program is meant to do, so if that woks, basically anything will.

## Behvaiour:

If any letters/numbers/symbols are not from the range [A-Za-z0-9] it simply will be ignored.
Only approved characters are dealt with.
